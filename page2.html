        <h2>Elisabeth Mathisen,  elmat7346</h2>
            <p>The high school I went to was Kongsberg Videregående Skole in the city Kongsberg, also known as KOVS.<br>
            There are approximately 6-7 teaching locations.<br>
            There isn't much to say about it, as it wasn't that memorable it was the people that were. <br>
            I studied electrical engineering with a study specialization and then there were 2 of us girls in my class and the rest were boys.</p>


            <h2>Stian Gunnerus Haugen, s371395</h2>
            <p>I went to Sande VGS, which was an experience to say the least. Lots of wonderful friendships were made, many of which still stand today.</p>
            <p>The peak of my time there was when we chopped down a tree from outside in the forest, and dragged it into our classroom to be used as a christmas tree without permission.</p>


            <h2>Herman Grønseth, hegro8348</h2>
            <p>The high school I attended was the fabled Edvard Munch videregående skole, a school named after Edvard Munch.<br>
            The student body at my school consisted of approximately 90% girls and 10% boys.<br> 
            We also had a pingpong and a foosball table, I was horrible at pingpong, but at foosball I was pretty good.</p>
