            <h1>Information about the group</h1>
                <p> Here is some information about the different high schools each of our group members went to:</p>

            <h2>Elisabeth Mathisen,  elmat7346</h2>
                <p>The high school I went to was Kongsberg Videregående Skole, also known as KOVS in the city Kongsberg.
                There are approximately 6-7 teaching locations.
                There isn't much to say about it, as it wasn't that memorable it was the people that were.
                I studied electrical engineering with a study specialization and then there were 2 of us girls in my class and the rest were boys.</p>


            <h2>Stian Gunnerus Haugen, s371395</h2>
                <p>I went to Sande VGS, which was an experience to say the least. Lots of wonderful friendships were made, many of which still stand today. 
                    The peak of my time there was when we chopped down a tree from outside in the forest, 
                    and dragged it into our classroom to be used as a christmas tree without permission.</p>

            <h2>Herman Grønseth, hegro8348</h2>
                <p>The high school I attended was the fabled Edvard Munch videregående skole, a school named after Edvard Munch.
                The student body at my school consisted of approximately 90% girls and 10% boys.
                We also had a pingpong and a foosball table, I was horrible at pingpong, but at foosball I was pretty good.</p>
