            <h2>Elisabeth Mathisen,  elmat7346</h2>
                <p>The high school I went to was Kongsberg Videregående Skole, also known as KOVS in the city Kongsberg.<br>
                There are approximately 6-7 teaching locations.<br>
                There isn't much to say about it, as it wasn't that memorable it was the people that were. <br>
                I studied electrical engineering with a study specialization and then there were 2 of us girls in my class and the rest were boys.</p>


            <h2>Stian Gunnerus Haugen, s371395</h2>
                <p>I went to Sande VGS, which was an experience to say the least. Lots of wonderful friendships were made, many of which still stand today. <br> The peak of my time there was when we chopped down a tree from outside in the forest, and dragged it into our classroom to be used as a christmas tree without permission.</p>

            <h2>Herman Grønseth, hegro8348</h2>
                <p>The high school I attended was the fabled Edvard Munch videregående skole, a school named after Edvard Munch.<br>
                The student body at my school consisted of approximately 90% girls and 10% boys.<br> 
                We also had a pingpong and a foosball table, I was horrible at pingpong, but at foosball I was pretty good.</p>
